# NETWORKING-LABS
A collection of my networking labs using the Cisco Packet Tracer.
This repository contains a collection of networking projects and labs built with Cisco Packet Tracer. Overtime, this lab will be updated as i progress in my learning journey. 
It documents my journey learning **LAN, VLAN, IP addressing, WAN, and router configurations** step by step.


## 📌 Included Projects
1. **Basic Home Network** → Simple LAN setup with PCs, switch, and router.  
2. **LAN** → Multi-device LAN with static addressing.  
3. **VLAN** → VLAN segmentation and inter-VLAN routing (router-on-a-stick).  
4. **IP Addressing** → Static and dynamic (DHCP) IP addressing.  
5. **WAN** → Connecting two LANs via serial links and static routing.  
6. **Router Configurations** → General router setup for multiple scenarios (basic config, DHCP, static routing, OSPF, EIGRP, etc.).
